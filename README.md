# Magic Wallet

## Description

This device comes in two parts: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter resides inside a wallet, where dollar bills are secretly attached to hidden clips. When a bill is removed from, its clip becomes shorted to ground. The transmitter then sends the corresponding bill to the receiver (as an ASCII string) via RF. The receiver displays the bills on a LCD in the order that they are removed.
